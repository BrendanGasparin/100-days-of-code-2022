# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: September 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Separated earth-from-space JS code from brendangasparin.com and put it in its own repository. Began working through the new Foundations lessons on The Odin Project.

**Thoughts** After playing with the brendangasparin.com and earth-from-space repositories I realised I am rusty and may need to brush up on core web development skills again. But I don't feel like taking the entire Responsive Web Design certification on freeCodeCamp again so I am instead going to work on the new Foundations lessons on The Odin Project before using both The Odin Project and freeCodeCamp to practice my JavaScript some more. I would also like to learn more PHP and get better with SQL.

### Day 2: September 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished The Odin Project Foundations module's Odin Recipes project.

**Thoughts**: It may have seemed a bit basic going over HTML in the last 24 hours but I picked up a few things I didn't already know, particularly about list styling (which is more CSS, but whatever) from an article linked on The Odin Project curriculum. I bookmarked the article under Computing/Development/Web Development/HTML in Chrome. Now that I've finished the Odin Recipes project I have moved onto the CSS part of the course.
