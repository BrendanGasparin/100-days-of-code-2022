# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: September 10, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Separated earth-from-space JS code from my personal website and put it in its own repository. Began working through the new Foundations lessons on The Odin Project.

**Thoughts:** After playing with the personal website and earth-from-space repositories I realised I am rusty and may need to brush up on core web development skills again. But I don't feel like taking the entire Responsive Web Design certification on freeCodeCamp again so I am instead going to work on the new Foundations lessons on The Odin Project before using both The Odin Project and freeCodeCamp to practice my JavaScript some more. I would also like to learn more PHP and get better with SQL.

### Day 2: September 11, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Finished The Odin Project Foundations module's Odin Recipes project. Started on the CSS Foundations module. Started styling the recipe project in a new cookbook repository. Worked on personal website (though I did not upload the work to the server as it contains empty links and is not ready to go live).

**Thoughts:** It may have seemed a bit basic going over HTML in the last 24 hours but I picked up a few things I didn't already know, particularly about list styling (which is more CSS, but whatever) from an article linked on The Odin Project curriculum. I bookmarked the [article](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/creating-lists/) under Computing/Development/Web Development/HTML in Chrome. Now that I've finished the Odin Recipes project I have moved onto the CSS part of the course.

### Day 3: September 12, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Finished The Odin Project CSS module. Hours of reading, not much coding. Had to continue styling the cookbook to make up a total hour of coding for the day. Then at 5am I coded my personal website some more (but did not upload to the server).

**Thoughts:** Today involved a lot of reading, mostly covering things I already knew. But I did learn a lot about the [CSS box model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model) from the linked article. I learned about the difference between inline, block, and inline-block boxes, which I was perhaps a little unclear on before. I also learned about the difference between outer and inner display types, and the different display types. Looking forward to getting back to JavaScript material, but first I have to complete The Odin Project Flexbox module and then complete a landing page project. While working on my personal website I decided the article I linked in Day 2 has maybe the best and simplest method of marking up and styling a nav bar that I have seen.

### Day 4: September 13, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Worked through most of The Odin Project Flexbox material, including seven Flexbox exercises.

**Thoughts:** Had difficulty finding an hour to code due to family responsibilities and Halo 4. But I did.

**Link(s) to work:** N/A (Did not upload the exercises)

### Day 5: September 14, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Worked through the final exercise in The Odin Project Flexbox material.

**Thoughts:** Learned the holy grail layout. I have been creating this layout myself for years without knowing it had a name. But now, with Flexbox and media queries, I can make it responsive on smaller screens.

### Day 6: September 15, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Added a new recipe to the cookbook website and changed its styling a little. Recreated the holy grail layout from memory in HTML and CSS.

**Thoughts:** I spent just over the bare minimum requirement for one hour of coding today (before midnight - I additionally coded the holy grail at 3-4am). If I want to improve faster I will have to devote more time in the future.
