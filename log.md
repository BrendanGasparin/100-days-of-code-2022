# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: May 10, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Completed problem set 1 from online [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/) course.

**Thoughts:** Attempting 100 Days of Code for a second time. I am going to do the CS50 online course to practice C. When I get to the Python material I am going to do some pen-testing courses to supplement that, and when I get to the web development material I will continue and finish my progress in freeCodeCamp and the Odin Project.

### Day 2: May 11, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Completed Lab 2 problem Scrabble from online [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/) course.

**Thoughts:** I watched a two hour CS50 lecture before attempting problems today. It took me four hours because I was having trouble concentrating and kept having to rewind. Apparently my chosen path, CS50, is going to involve a lot of time watching video lectures in addition to the time I need to spend coding for the 100 Days challenge. Of course, I can intersperse CS50 with my own projects if I ever get tired of watching videos.

# 100 Days Of Code (2021) - Log


### Day 1: September 10, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Separated earth-from-space JS code from my personal website and put it in its own repository. Began working through the new Foundations lessons on The Odin Project.

**Thoughts:** After playing with the personal website and earth-from-space repositories I realised I am rusty and may need to brush up on core web development skills again. But I don't feel like taking the entire Responsive Web Design certification on freeCodeCamp again so I am instead going to work on the new Foundations lessons on The Odin Project before using both The Odin Project and freeCodeCamp to practice my JavaScript some more. I would also like to learn more PHP and get better with SQL.

### Day 2: September 11, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Finished The Odin Project Foundations module's Odin Recipes project. Started on the CSS Foundations module. Started styling the recipe project in a new cookbook repository. Worked on personal website (though I did not upload the work to the server as it contains empty links and is not ready to go live).

**Thoughts:** It may have seemed a bit basic going over HTML in the last 24 hours but I picked up a few things I didn't already know, particularly about list styling (which is more CSS, but whatever) from an article linked on The Odin Project curriculum. I bookmarked the [article](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/creating-lists/) under Computing/Development/Web Development/HTML in Chrome. Now that I've finished the Odin Recipes project I have moved onto the CSS part of the course.

### Day 3: September 12, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Finished The Odin Project CSS module. Hours of reading, not much coding. Had to continue styling the cookbook to make up a total hour of coding for the day. Then at 5am I coded my personal website some more (but did not upload to the server).

**Thoughts:** Today involved a lot of reading, mostly covering things I already knew. But I did learn a lot about the [CSS box model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model) from the linked article. I learned about the difference between inline, block, and inline-block boxes, which I was perhaps a little unclear on before. I also learned about the difference between outer and inner display types, and the different display types. Looking forward to getting back to JavaScript material, but first I have to complete The Odin Project Flexbox module and then complete a landing page project. While working on my personal website I decided the article I linked in Day 2 has maybe the best and simplest method of marking up and styling a nav bar that I have seen.

### Day 4: September 13, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Worked through most of The Odin Project Flexbox material, including seven Flexbox exercises.

**Thoughts:** Had difficulty finding an hour to code due to family responsibilities and Halo 4. But I did.

**Link(s) to work:** N/A (Did not upload the exercises)

### Day 5: September 14, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Worked through the final exercise in The Odin Project Flexbox material.

**Thoughts:** Learned the holy grail layout. I have been creating this layout myself for years without knowing it had a name. But now, with Flexbox and media queries, I can make it responsive on smaller screens.

**Link(s) to work:** N/A (Did not upload the exercise)

### Day 6: September 15, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Added a new recipe to the cookbook website and changed its styling a little. Recreated the holy grail layout from memory in HTML and CSS.

**Thoughts:** I spent just over the bare minimum requirement for one hour of coding today (before midnight - I additionally coded the holy grail at 3-4am). If I want to improve faster I will have to devote more time in the future.

### Day 7: September 16, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Watched 14 of the videos on [Flexbox.io](https://flexbox.io). Worked on personal website.

**Thoughts:** I told Twitter I was going to work through the [Flexbox.io](https://flexbox.io) code-along videos, but these videos did not start the code from scratch and seemed to cover material I already knew, so I worked on my personal website instead.

**Link(s) to work:** N/A (Did not update the live version of the personal website.)

### Day 8: September 17, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Worked on [personal website](https://brendangasparin.com).

**Thoughts:** I really want to finish The Odin Project's Flexbox module, but it involves a lot of reading and video watching and playing Flex-based games, none of which is actually coding, and I have to make up 1 hour of coding per day to meet the challenge. So, because I am squeezed for time due to family, I worked on my personal website today instead of The Odin Project. Hoping to finish the Flexbox module later when I have more time to myself.

### Day 9: September 18, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Worked on [personal website](https://brendangasparin.com). Refactored HTML into PHP includes to cut back on space, and added an About page.

**Thoughts:** Another day where I spent the bare minimum time coding and gained no progress on The Odin Project. It is a Saturday, though.

### Day 10: September 19, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Worked on [personal website](https://brendangasparin.com). Incorporated touch screen controls and content scrolling on a central div element while the header and footer of the page remain stationary. Played [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/). Started The Odin Project [Landing Page](https://brendangasparin.github.io/odin-landing-page/) project.

**Thoughts:** Watched the rest of the videos at [What the Flexbox?!](https://flexbox.io). Worked through the rest of The Odin Project's Flexbox material. Started on the landing page project.

### Day 11: September 20, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Completed The Odin Project [Landing Page](https://brendangasparin.github.io/odin-landing-page/) project.

**Thoughts:** Completed The Odin Project's landing page project. You have to duplicate a layout, typography, and colour scheme, as if they were given to you by a client. The problem is that the layout is very horizontal and would look terrible on a mobile device. Making it responsive would be very difficult and time-consuming and is not a requirement of the project, but responsiveness is a very important part of modern web design. So I feel like the project will be fairly useless for inclusion in a portfolio. I just wanted to finish it as quick as possible and move onto the Javascript material, so I worked on it into the early hours of the morning, until it looked good on 1920x1080 resolution. I turned off the meta viewport tag and it looks kind of okay on a mobile device although the image row is cramped and skewed. Looking forward to the JavaScript material, although I have to remember to keep a handle on HTML and CSS basics as well.

### Day 12: September 21, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Worked through some JavaScript basics on The Odin Project and freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Cannot decide between The Odin Project and freeCodeCamp. I think I might use the former for when I want to passively consume content like articles and videos, and the latter when I need to get in my hour of coding for the day. Trying to keep notes in a Google Drive doc. It is slowing me down but I assume the writing process is helping me learn better. Watched an [interesting take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhhdfoPiY0U) on rapid learning from @theXSSrat on Twitter. Much the same way that I rushed the landing page project yesterday, I am now wondering about the trade-off between perfectionism (e.g. in taking notes on every small detail I learn) and just doing all the things ASAP so I can move to more advanced stages. Not sure where I stand. JavaScript has a lot of quirks I might need to know, but I just spent over an hour taking notes on variable assignment alone and that might not be the most productive use of my time.

### Day 13: September 22, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Made a ROT13 converter with JavaScript and a HTML form. Worked through JavaScript material about strings and arrays on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Sleep schedule is upside down, nocturnal, because I am up all night reading and watching videos and doing code and Twitter. The #100DaysOfCode challenge is taking its toll on my sleep schedule, but I do not want to stop. Last night I stayed up all night coding, and then switched to [PicoCTF](https://picoctf.org) to wind down, but ended up coding the ROT13 Converter at 4am to help with a challenge (and because I'd rather write websites than get CTF flags, I guess). I am writing this log entry at 4:30am on the 23rd September after a similar bout of coding on freeCodeCamp. Seriously considering trying to stay awake all day to reset my sleep schedule. If I do, then Day 13 and 14 are going to merge into one weird long stretch of coding and sleep deprivation.

### Day 14: September 23, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Worked through arrays and function sections of freeCodeCamp Basic JavaScript course. Worked on own project: what I hope will be a PHP CRUD app.

**Thoughts:** Slept for four hours in the morning. Did freeCodeCamp tutorials all day and worked on the basic HTML and CSS of the CRUD app in the early hours of the next morning. I have already written a PHP authenticator (just before starting this log) so I believe I can do this CRUD app. I just have to make sure I do not flake on my JavaScript studies while I do it.

### Day 15: September 24, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Worked through Basic JavaScript material on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Flying through the Basic JavaScript course because it is mostly material I know from other programming languages. I'm just noting down the ways in which JavaScript is different (and often more versatile) than other languages. Because I didn't have anything but freeCodeCamp screenshots to post on Twitter, I posted a shot of the CRUD app I was trying to make the previous night (which is actually early morning of today anyway).

### Day 16: September 25, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Finished the Basic JavaScript material on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Out of all the Basic JavaScript material, I think I need to be most mindful of objects and array methods, because these things seem different from what I know from other languages. I find it strange that the material has not covered DOM manipulation and I wonder if all of the material at freeCodeCamp will simply be about printing things to the console. I hope not.

If I complete another freeCodeCamp JavaScript course I will be father than I have ever gotten on freeCodeCamp.

### Day 17: September 26, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Working on the ES6 material on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Taking thorough notes, because everything I learn from here on is new to me. Accidentally fell asleep at about 9pm, so didn't do the Twitter stuff until 1am on the 27th.

**Link(s) to work:** [freeCodeCamp profile](https://www.freecodecamp.org/brendangasparin)

### Day 18: September 27, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Finished the ES6 course from JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification on freeCodeCamp. Also revised DOM manipulation on The Odin Project and wrote a FizzBuzz program.

**Thoughts:** Most of this ES6 material is new to me. I may have to revise it several times before I remember it, or just refer back to it when I need it. Not even sure how I would practice some of this stuff, like asynchronous promises. Like I said, refer back to it when I need it.

Just noticed that my links to work for the last several days are just my freeCodeCamp profile. It's good to learn new things, but according to the #100DaysOfCode challenge I'm supposed to be building my own projects. I should code my own stuff more in between doing tutorials.

**Link(s) to work:** [FizzBuzz Generator](https://brendangasparin.github.io/fizzbuzz-js/)

### Day 19: September 28, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Started the #JavaScript30 challenge and did the drumkit tutorial for the second time this year.

**Thoughts:** Not sure how I will go doing #100DaysOfCode, freeCodeCamp, The Odin Project, and the #JavaScript30 challenges at the same time. I'm supposed to be coding my own stuff, not doing tutorials. But I did learn some things from the drumkit tutorial, and it was cool to make something that functional.

**Link(s) to work:** [JavaScript30 Drumkit](https://brendangasparin.github.io/javascript30-drumkit/)

### Day 20: September 29, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Wrote a Twitter bot with Python's Tweepy library. Made an "analogue" clock as part of #JavaScript30.

**Thoughts:** I got a huge rush from making the Twitter bot in the early hours of the morning and did not fall asleep until 9am. Ran my Twitter bot all day, auto-liking #100DaysOfCode posts. It liked a lot of spam. I got 1 follower. Woke up at about 7pm and did the #JavaScript30 task at around midnight. Writing this at 4am. Coding messes with my sleep schedule badly.

**Link(s) to work:** [JavaScript30 Clock](https://brendangasparin.github.io/javascript30-clock/)

### Day 21: September 30, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Learned how to modify CSS variables with JavaScript as day 3 of #JavaScript30.

**Thoughts:** Stay the course, kid.

**Link(s) to work:** [JavaScript30 CSS Variables](https://brendangasparin.github.io/javascript30-css-variables/)

### Day 21: October 1, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Completed Array Cardio Day 1 exercise as day 4 of #JavaScript30.

**Thoughts:** Learned about JavaScript array methods, which I did not know before.
