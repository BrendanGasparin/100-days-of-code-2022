# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: September 10, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Separated earth-from-space JS code from my personal website and put it in its own repository. Began working through the new Foundations lessons on The Odin Project.

**Thoughts:** After playing with the personal website and earth-from-space repositories I realised I am rusty and may need to brush up on core web development skills again. But I don't feel like taking the entire Responsive Web Design certification on freeCodeCamp again so I am instead going to work on the new Foundations lessons on The Odin Project before using both The Odin Project and freeCodeCamp to practice my JavaScript some more. I would also like to learn more PHP and get better with SQL.

### Day 2: September 11, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Finished The Odin Project Foundations module's Odin Recipes project. Started on the CSS Foundations module. Started styling the recipe project in a new cookbook repository. Worked on personal website (though I did not upload the work to the server as it contains empty links and is not ready to go live).

**Thoughts:** It may have seemed a bit basic going over HTML in the last 24 hours but I picked up a few things I didn't already know, particularly about list styling (which is more CSS, but whatever) from an article linked on The Odin Project curriculum. I bookmarked the [article](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/creating-lists/) under Computing/Development/Web Development/HTML in Chrome. Now that I've finished the Odin Recipes project I have moved onto the CSS part of the course.

### Day 3: September 12, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Finished The Odin Project CSS module. Hours of reading, not much coding. Had to continue styling the cookbook to make up a total hour of coding for the day. Then at 5am I coded my personal website some more (but did not upload to the server).

**Thoughts:** Today involved a lot of reading, mostly covering things I already knew. But I did learn a lot about the [CSS box model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model) from the linked article. I learned about the difference between inline, block, and inline-block boxes, which I was perhaps a little unclear on before. I also learned about the difference between outer and inner display types, and the different display types. Looking forward to getting back to JavaScript material, but first I have to complete The Odin Project Flexbox module and then complete a landing page project. While working on my personal website I decided the article I linked in Day 2 has maybe the best and simplest method of marking up and styling a nav bar that I have seen.

### Day 4: September 13, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Worked through most of The Odin Project Flexbox material, including seven Flexbox exercises.

**Thoughts:** Had difficulty finding an hour to code due to family responsibilities and Halo 4. But I did.

**Link(s) to work:** N/A (Did not upload the exercises)

### Day 5: September 14, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Worked through the final exercise in The Odin Project Flexbox material.

**Thoughts:** Learned the holy grail layout. I have been creating this layout myself for years without knowing it had a name. But now, with Flexbox and media queries, I can make it responsive on smaller screens.

**Link(s) to work:** N/A (Did not upload the exercise)

### Day 6: September 15, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Added a new recipe to the cookbook website and changed its styling a little. Recreated the holy grail layout from memory in HTML and CSS.

**Thoughts:** I spent just over the bare minimum requirement for one hour of coding today (before midnight - I additionally coded the holy grail at 3-4am). If I want to improve faster I will have to devote more time in the future.

### Day 7: September 16, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Watched 14 of the videos on [Flexbox.io](https://flexbox.io). Worked on personal website.

**Thoughts:** I told Twitter I was going to work through the [Flexbox.io](https://flexbox.io) code-along videos, but these videos did not start the code from scratch and seemed to cover material I already knew, so I worked on my personal website instead.

**Link(s) to work:** N/A (Did not update the live version of the personal website.)

### Day 8: September 17, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Worked on [personal website](https://brendangasparin.com).

**Thoughts:** I really want to finish The Odin Project's Flexbox module, but it involves a lot of reading and video watching and playing Flex-based games, none of which is actually coding, and I have to make up 1 hour of coding per day to meet the challenge. So, because I am squeezed for time due to family, I worked on my personal website today instead of The Odin Project. Hoping to finish the Flexbox module later when I have more time to myself.

### Day 9: September 18, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Worked on [personal website](https://brendangasparin.com). Refactored HTML into PHP includes to cut back on space, and added an About page.

**Thoughts:** Another day where I spent the bare minimum time coding and gained no progress on The Odin Project. It is a Saturday, though.

### Day 10: September 19, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Worked on [personal website](https://brendangasparin.com). Incorporated touch screen controls and content scrolling on a central div element while the header and footer of the page remain stationary. Played [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/). Started The Odin Project [Landing Page](https://brendangasparin.github.io/odin-landing-page/) project.

**Thoughts:** Watched the rest of the videos at [What the Flexbox?!](https://flexbox.io). Worked through the rest of The Odin Project's Flexbox material. Started on the landing page project.

### Day 11: September 20, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Completed The Odin Project [Landing Page](https://brendangasparin.github.io/odin-landing-page/) project.

**Thoughts:** Completed The Odin Project's landing page project. You have to duplicate a layout, typography, and colour scheme, as if they were given to you by a client. The problem is that the layout is very horizontal and would look terrible on a mobile device. Making it responsive would be very difficult and time-consuming and is not a requirement of the project, but responsiveness is a very important part of modern web design. So I feel like the project will be fairly useless for inclusion in a portfolio. I just wanted to finish it as quick as possible and move onto the Javascript material, so I worked on it into the early hours of the morning, until it looked good on 1920x1080 resolution. I turned off the meta viewport tag and it looks kind of okay on a mobile device although the image row is cramped and skewed. Looking forward to the JavaScript material, although I have to remember to keep a handle on HTML and CSS basics as well.

### Day 12: September 21, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Worked through some JavaScript basics on The Odin Project and freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Cannot decide between The Odin Project and freeCodeCamp. I think I might use the former for when I want to passively consume content like articles and videos, and the latter when I need to get in my hour of coding for the day. Trying to keep notes in a Google Drive doc. It is slowing me down but I assume the writing process is helping me learn better. Watched an [interesting take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhhdfoPiY0U) on rapid learning from @theXSSrat on Twitter. Much the same way that I rushed the landing page project yesterday, I am now wondering about the trade-off between perfectionism (e.g. in taking notes on every small detail I learn) and just doing all the things ASAP so I can move to more advanced stages. Not sure where I stand. JavaScript has a lot of quirks I might need to know, but I just spent over an hour taking notes on variable assignment alone and that might not be the most productive use of my time.
